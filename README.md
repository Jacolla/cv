This is the project for make up my Personal CV to the sector of Software Development.

Would like to star in this world... after almonst, all my life playing with PC, fixing Software problems,
Hadware problems, even once, i had to bake the graphic card, because it needed a hit oh heat for some welds.
Most of what i had done was for play being fair, looking for a way to get in a game without pay for it, and i should say
that, between the cracker's, the comunity of gamers ( the wild's one's... ) it's pretty easy to get a game without paying... even online!


Anyway, i would like to star in this sector, so I'm on my way.
